== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have an image attatched to a post that isn't embedded in your gallery? =

Nope, not yet anyway. I could add that relitivly easity but it's low on my priority list. Let me know if it's important to you and I'll get right on it.

= How can I change the colors or styling? =

That is higher on my priority list. For the time being you have to edit the plugin. The CSS is near the top of the lwegallery.php file, and you should be able to edit it from within wordpress.
